                                The Hub gets revealed. This is an interactive members-only area where we will reveal new
                                content for Wanderers.

                                means for your unique Wanderer.

                                Itâ€™s time to reveal what the Wanderers look like - we will create animated avatars so
                                you can see your pilots.

                                No Wanderer is complete without their own personal spaceship. We will begin working on
                                3D generative ships for your Wanderer to use across the metaverse and beyond.

                                We want to continue building The Hub into an interactive space station where you can
                                display your NFTs and interact with other Wanderers.
