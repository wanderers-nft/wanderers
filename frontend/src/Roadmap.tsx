                                The Hub gets revealed. This is a members-only area where we will reveal new content for
                                Wanderers.

                                Itâ€™s time to reveal what the Wanderers look like - we will create animated avatars so
                                you can see your pilots.

                                No Wanderer is complete without their own personal spaceship. We will begin working on
                                3D generative ships for your Wanderer to use across the metaverse and beyond.
